# code-quiz

## Description

    The objective of this project is to create an interactive web page that offers a coding quiz, providing users with an engaging and challenging experience. The quiz will include a timed multiple-choice questionnaire, enriched with interactive coding challenges. By storing high scores, the aim is to enable users to measure their progress against their peers. When the user clicks the start button, a timer begins, and they are presented with a question. Upon answering a question, another question appears. If a question is answered incorrectly, time is deducted from the clock. The game ends when all questions are answered or the timer runs out. At the end of the game, users can save their initials and score. The web page is designed to run smoothly in a browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS elements driven by custom JavaScript code. The user interface is clean, polished, and responsive, ensuring an enjoyable experience. The primary goals of this project are to improve proficiency in JavaScript and web APIs while gaining familiarity with commonly used assessment formats in interviews.
